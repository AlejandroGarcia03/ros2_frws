[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsignal_params.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "signal_params", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "signal_params"
  with any of the following names:

    signal_paramsConfig.cmake
    signal_params-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "signal_params" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "signal_params_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "signal_params" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
