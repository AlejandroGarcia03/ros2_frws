[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsignal_parameters.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "signal_parameters", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "signal_parameters"
  with any of the following names:

    signal_parametersConfig.cmake
    signal_parameters-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "signal_parameters" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "signal_parameters_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "signal_parameters" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
